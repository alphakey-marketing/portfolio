    title: "Coffee or tea? Right, wrong, or neutral? I carefully consider it all."
    subtitle: >-
      Hi, I'm a slightly unconventional marketer.


      By day, I craft copy, analyze data, and design strategies for brands. By night, I meditate in stillness, using spiritual intuition to sense the authentic energy behind each brand. Weekends? You'll find me on the badminton court, chasing that little white shuttlecock with sweat dripping down.


      Friends say I'm detail-oriented (sometimes annoyingly so), but what I'm most proud of is my ability to view problems from three perspectives: right, wrong, and neutral. This helps me find balance in the gray-area world of marketing.


      I believe the best marketing strategy is like playing badminton: it requires technique, but even more so, intuition.
